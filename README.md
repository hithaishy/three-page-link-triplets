# three-page-link-triplets



To identify three-page link triples

[1]------->[2]----------->[3]

This support following parameters:

Have simply generate the following output: <“3, 2”, 1 >
Webpages 3 and 2 are concatenated into a single value. If there are multiple webpages having links to page 2, which further has links to page 3, the output should be: <“3, 2”,“1, 4, 5, 6, 7”>
all pages in a three-page link triple need to be DISTINCT! For example, triples corresponding to the following examples, i.e., <“3, 2”, 2 > or <“1, 1”, 1 >, should not be included in the output.
